# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 4 problems on Hackerrank. 3 from the Algorithms section (Plus Minus, Staircase, Mini-Max-Sum) and one from the 30 days of Code section (30DOC) (No.19 - Interfaces). 

**Thoughts:** Might be a slow start compared to what level I want to be at? But a good start. Should work on punctuality.

### Day 1: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 problems on Hackerrank. 2 from the 30DOC section (Nos.20 and 21) and one from Problem Solving (Birthday Cake Candles). Stuck on 'Time Conversion' problem.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't think clearly (tired). But getting more comfortable with Python. Should be able to code fluently soon.

### Day 2: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'Time Conversion' problem. No. 22 and 23 on 30DOC were based on binary trees, so started learning about them. (MITOCW Intro to Algorithms Lecture 5)

**Thoughts:** Didn't make much progress today on problem solving, but did some learning.

### Day 3: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued the lecture on Binary Trees. Didn't get any coding done today.

### Day 4: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Compensated for not coding on the previous day. Solved 5 problems in 30DOC (22,23,24,25,26) and problem 1 on ProjectEuler+. Finished the lecture on Binary Trees too.

**Thoughts:** Felt good after coding a lot today. ProjectEuler+ seems like it could be great practice. Need to solve more problems to improve algorithmic thinking as I had to go through the discussions to learn the approach for a few of the problems.

### Day 5: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem 2 in ProjectEuler+. Stuck in problem 3. Will get back to it later today.

**Thoughts:** Should reduce solving problems and start working on real projects

### Day 6: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning EDA a little. Also some research for Health Monitoring Unit.

### Day 7: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved remaining 3 problems in 30DOC (27,28,29). Re-attempting Project Euler problem 3

**Thoughts:** First achievement today. Finished 30DOC (finally :P).

### Day 8: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still stuck on problem 3. Couldn't wrap my head around the problem.

### Day 9: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed and fiddled around with tensorflow-gpu.

**Thoughts:** This should be the base for future projects.

### Few days in October

**Progress**: Started and finished most of the Health Monitor GUI using **Kivy** for Python. Learnt from the book **Creating Apps in Kivy** by Dusty Philips. Free trial on the O'Reilly website.

**Thoughts:** Haven't included these days in the day count as I don't exactly know when or how many days I worked on it.

### Day 10: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Gave basic functionality to the Health Monitor GUI. (Use of buttons to switch between pages)

**Thoughts:** Restarting 100DOC. 

### Day 11: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Upper Confidence Bound algorithm intuition (ML A-Z Course)

**Thoughts:** Should do more in a day if possible

### Day 12: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished coding part of Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (ML A-Z Course)

**Thoughts:** Should do more in a day if possible 

### Day 13: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Thompson Sampling intuition (ML A-Z Course)

**Thoughts:** Should do more in a day if possible 

### Day 14: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished coding part of Thompson Sampling algorithm (ML A-Z Course)

**Thoughts:** Should do more in a day if possible 

### Day 15: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Recurrent Neural Networks intuition (ML A-Z Course)

**Thoughts:** Should do more in a day if possible 

### Day 16: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with the code for the task scheduling algorithm using rate monotonic criterion. Finished till testing the criterion and setting the priorities.

**Thoughts:** Had fun as the algorithm is very interesting.

### Day 17: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the task scheduling algorithm using the rate monotonic criterion. Implemented the scheduling part of the algorithm.

**Thoughts:** Found it tough to implement the scheduling part as it involves a lot of logic. Figured it out though. Felt great :D

### Day 18: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made the execution trace (bar plot using matplotlib) for the task scheduling algorithm. Turned out well.

**Thoughts:** Had fun going through the matplotlib documentation to find suitable functions and arguments to tailor make the plot.

### Day 19: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building the housing for the Raspberry Pi touch screen (banggood.in).

**Thoughts:** I know it's not actually coding, but I'm just including it because I think it counts as progress.

### Day 20: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the housing. Also, made all the required connections and tested the display. Display and touch work fine with the Raspberry Pi. Touch axes are inverted.

**Thoughts:** Same as day 19, but this counts as progress as both are needed for me to start coding on the Raspberry Pi (GUI and any future projects).

### Day 21: November 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the inverted axes issue by reversing the wires from the touch module PCB. Calibrated the screen for better touch accuracy by following the calibration guide (xinput-calibrator library). Installed the Kivy library.

**Thoughts:** Got some basic setup done today for future work on the Raspberry Pi-TouchScreen build. Need to calibrate the screen again as I don't feel it's very accurate right now too.

### Day 22: November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the issue of having installed the development version Kivy library to a pip installed stable version. Enabled touch for Kivy GUI and ran Kivy GUI examples. 

**Thoughts:** Took a long time to fix the library installation. Kivy library is installed to work for Python2.7. Have to change it to work for Python 3. Also, have to enable mouse cursor and keyboard for use in the GUI.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
