# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 4 problems on Hackerrank. 3 from the Algorithms section (Plus Minus, Staircase, Mini-Max-Sum) and one from the 30 days of Code section (30DOC) (No.19 - Interfaces). 

**Thoughts:** Might be a slow start compared to what level I want to be at? But a good start. Should work on punctuality.

### Day 1: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 problems on Hackerrank. 2 from the 30DOC section (Nos.20 and 21) and one from Problem Solving (Birthday Cake Candles). Stuck on 'Time Conversion' problem.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't think clearly (tired). But getting more comfortable with Python. Should be able to code fluently soon.

### Day 2: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'Time Conversion' problem. No. 22 and 23 on 30DOC were based on binary trees, so started learning about them. (MITOCW Intro to Algorithms Lecture 5)

**Thoughts:** Didn't make much progress today on problem solving, but did some learning.

### Day 3: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued the lecture on Binary Trees. Didn't get any coding done today.

### Day 4: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Compensated for not coding on the previous day. Solved 5 problems in 30DOC (22,23,24,25,26) and problem 1 on ProjectEuler+. Finished the lecture on Binary Trees too.

**Thoughts:** Felt good after coding a lot today. ProjectEuler+ seems like it could be great practice. Need to solve more problems to improve algorithmic thinking as I had to go through the discussions to learn the approach for a few of the problems.

### Day 5: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem 2 in ProjectEuler+. Stuck in problem 3. Will get back to it later today.

**Thoughts:** Should reduce solving problems and start working on real projects

### Day 6: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning EDA a little. Also some research for Health Monitoring Unit.

### Day 7: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved remaining 3 problems in 30DOC (27,28,29). Re-attempting Project Euler problem 3

**Thoughts:** First achievement today. Finished 30DOC (finally :P).

### Day 8: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still stuck on problem 3. Couldn't wrap my head around the problem.

### Day 9: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed and fiddled around with tensorflow-gpu.

**Thoughts:** This should be the base for future projects.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
